I am Sofia Scatolin, a Ph.D. student in developmental neuroscience. Currently I am investigating the intergenerational transfer of socioemotional skills, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and behavioural assessments. I am fascinated by how children learn and how parents foster this process. In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering and hiking.
